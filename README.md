- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ritchee92
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a Full Stack Developer or wherever my path takes me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CS50x Introduction to Computer Science. I also use other resources to help such as freecodecamp.org, replit.com, Mimo (app), Sololearn (app) and looking for any suggestions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to learn how to build great and exciting projects. I have some experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C but still consider myself a beginner.
- 📫 Best way to reach me would be at ryan.richie92@outlook.com to discuss potential projects, websites, or even resources.
- 😄 Pronouns: He / Him
- ⚡ Fun facts: The most important thing to me is spending time with my family but when I have free time I teach myself how to play many different instruments from drums, guitar, piano, mandolin and a few others as well as learning music theory, trading financial markets, and learning about my spirituality. I believe in trying to better yourself physically, mentally and spiritually.
